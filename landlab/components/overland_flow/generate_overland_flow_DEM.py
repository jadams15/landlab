    '''  Landlab component that simulates overland flow using the Bates et al., (2010) approximations
of the 1D shallow water equations to be used for 2D flood inundation modeling. 
    
This component calculates discharge, depth and shear stress after some precipitation event across
any raster grid. Default input file is named "overland_flow_input.txt' and is contained in the
landlab.components.overland_flow folder.
        
Inputs
------
    grid : Requires a RasterGridModel instance
        
    input_file : Contains necessary and optional inputs. If not given, default input file is used.
        - Manning's n is REQUIRED.
        - Storm duration is needed IF rain_duration is not passed in the initialization
        - Rainfall intensity is needed IF rainfall_intensity is not passed in the initialization
        - Model run time can be provided in initialization. If not it is set to the storm duration

            To specify a particular range of shear stress values, the following call
            can be added to the function. Say we want the low values on the color bar to start at 10

            Slopes are initially calculated at active links. Then, using these 
            active link values, slopes are calculated at each interior node.
            This takes slope values from that node vector, creates a new node vector
            containing the arctangent of each original slope value, and
            converts that node vector into a raster.

            If this value is changed, the value in the pylab.clim()
            function MUST also be changed.
            
            Additionally, the maximum value for plotted slopes is 50,

            edited. The minimum (by default 0.01) must be changed in the set_under() and
            clim() calls. The maximum must be changed in the clim() call only.

""" coupled_rainfire.py

This driver evaluates rainfall and fire time series looking for an overlap
which could signify the potential for a large erosion event.

This code runs the fire and rainfall generators for 100 years baed on
input values in the default input file 'fireraininput.txt'. 

This simulation parameters are based on central Colorado mean values, based on
values from Cannon et al., 2008 and Moody and Martin, 2001. It is not advised to
use this sample driver and parameters to model fire and precipitation-driven 
erosion events in other study areas.
